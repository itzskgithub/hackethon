        <h4>Synopsis</h4>
        India faces worsening water crises due to reduced river flows and falling water tables, exacerbated by climate change. The government's focus on tap water connections needs to shift towards holistic water management, including aquifer health. Experts recommend rainwater harvesting, efficient irrigation, groundwater regulation, technology integration, and inter-state collaboration to ensure sustainable water resources.

        <p>Reduced river flows and falling water tables are intensifying impact across India, leading to water crises in major cities and reigniting disputes over water allocation. In Bengaluru, a drought that began last year created a water crisis as early as March. Similarly, Delhi faced an emergency due to scorching temperatures, prompting the city government to approach the Supreme Court for an increased share of the Yamuna River's water.These recurring shortages highlight the need for a long-term water policy in India, especially with climate change exacerbating the situation. While the government has focused on providing tap water connections, the health of aquifers remains neglected," Dr. Praveen Chakravarthy Kakinada, whose NGO SYLOM works for water conservation in rural areas, said.

    <h4>Policy Gaps in Addressing Water Scarcity</h4>
    <p class="text"> India's recurring water crises highlight the need for a comprehensive policy to prevent such conflicts. While the government has emphasized providing tap water connections, aquifer health remains under-addressed. Historically, the focus has been on supply-side measures, such as constructing reservoirs or increasing extraction, rather than holistic water management.

    <h4>Steps Towards Efficient Water Use</h4>
    <p class="text"> Government programs have initiated steps toward improving water use in agriculture. "Still, greater emphasis is required on demand-side management, including analyzing water use in households and industries. India lacks comprehensive data on per capita water availability across user categories. Emergency measures, such as penalties for water wastage, are often reactionary. Incentivizing water conservation, reuse, and recycling would be more effective," Dr. Praveen Chakravarthy Kakinada said.
    </p>
    <h4>Climate Change: A Growing Threat to Aquifers</h4>
    <p class="text">With climate change exacerbating water shortages and threatening aquifers, India needs robust policies to safeguard resources. Here are some steps the government can adopt for better water management.
    </p>
    <h4>1. Enhancing Rainwater Harvesting Systems</h4>
    <p class="text">Rainwater harvesting can significantly alleviate water shortages. Expanding and enforcing rainwater collection systems, especially in urban areas, can recharge groundwater and reduce dependence on rivers. Local governments should incentivise households and industries to install rainwater harvesting structures.
    </p>
    <h4>2. Promoting Efficient Irrigation Techniques</h4>
    <p class="text">Agriculture consumes the majority of India’s water resources. "Switching to efficient irrigation methods such as drip irrigation and sprinkler systems can conserve water while maintaining crop yields," Dr. Chakravarthy Kakinada said. Initiatives like the Sahi Fasal Campaign should be scaled up to educate farmers about water-efficient practices and less water-intensive crops.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Strengthening Groundwater Management</h4>
    <p class="text">India’s aquifers are depleting at an alarming rate due to unregulated groundwater extraction. Policies to monitor and regulate groundwater usage must be enforced. Additionally, recharge zones should be identified, protected, and rejuvenated to restore aquifers.
    </p>
    <h4>4. Integrating Technology for Water Management</h4>
    <p class="text">"Technology-driven solutions, such as smart meters and sensors, can track water usage and detect leaks in distribution systems. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can help map water resources and plan their sustainable utilization. Investments in water recycling and treatment technologies can also ensure efficient reuse of wastewater," Dr. Chakravarthy added.
    </p>
    <h4>5. Inter-State Collaboration for Water Sharing</h4>
    <p class="text">Water-sharing disputes between states, such as those involving the Yamuna, highlight the need for robust frameworks. Setting up independent river basin authorities can facilitate equitable water sharing and resolution of conflicts. Collaborative planning between states is essential during both surplus and shortage seasons.
    </p>
    <h4>6. Public Awareness and Behavioral Change</h4>
    <p class="text">“Community participation is crucial for conserving water. Awareness campaigns highlighting the importance of water conservation, reuse, and recycling can encourage responsible usage. Incentives for water-saving behavior and penalties for wasteful practices can also drive behavioral change,” Dr. Praveen Chakravarthy Kakinada said.
    </p>
    <h4>7. Building Climate-Resilient Infrastructure</h4>
    <p class="text">With climate change intensifying water shortages, India needs infrastructure capable of withstanding extreme weather events. This includes flood-resistant storage systems, drought-resilient irrigation methods, and robust drainage networks.
    </p>
    <h4>8. Establishing Comprehensive Data Systems</h4>
    <p class="text">Reliable data on water usage, availability, and demand across sectors is essential for effective water management. Governments should invest in building centralized databases to track per capita water availability and identify areas needing immediate attention.
    </p>
    <p class="text">These measures, implemented holistically and sustainably, can address India’s growing water crisis and safeguard resources for future generations.
